# Overview

This dataset contains 196 images of raccoons and 213 bounding boxes (some images have two raccoons). This is a single class problem, and images vary in dimensions. It's a great first dataset for getting started with object detection.

This dataset was originally collected by [Dat Tran](https://github.com/datitran/raccoon_dataset), released with MIT license, and posted here with his permission.

# Use Cases

Find raccoons!

This dataset is a great starter dataset for building an object detection model. Dat has written a comprehensive tutorial [here](https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app).
